# Sea Shanty Generator
AI-generated sea shanties... yarrr

Here's a taste of the lyrical genius you can expect ðŸ˜‚
```
> Up jumps a crab with his crooked legs
Up jumps a crab with his crooked legs, I wonder what a sweetie! That's really the look. A crab with his crooked legs, I wonder what a sweetie! Whoa, a crab with a crooked legs, that's my name! So I go with the crab and go to the water,

Bitch you're a scoundrel
How long that'll take, I'm going to give her a day
And go and wash your clothes all down
```

## TODOs
- [x] Obtain the initial dataset from http://shanty.rendance.org
- [ ] Augment dataset more (names, places, etc. using NER and dictionary/MLM or paraphrase using eugenesiow/bart-paraphrase)
- [x] Train text generation model
- [ ] Resumable and longer training
- [ ] Deploy model to huggingface model hub
- [ ] ???   
- [ ] Profit

## Instructions
1. Create and activate a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
2. (Optional) Install torch for CPU if you don't have CUDA: `pip3 install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `python3 collect_dataset.py generated/raw_dataset.json` to download the dataset
5. Augment the dataset with `python3 augment_dataset.py generated/raw_dataset.json generated/augmented_dataset.json`
6. Train the model using `time python3 train.py generated/augmented_dataset.json generated/model [<checkpoint>]`
7. Try the model using `python3 interactive_demo.py generated/model`

## Train model in Google Colab
Run the following cells in Google Colab:
```bash
#@title Create dataset and train model
!rm -rf sea-shanty-generator && \
git clone https://github.com/rubenhorn/sea-shanty-generator.git && \
cd sea-shanty-generator && \
pip install -r requirements.txt && \
python3 collect_dataset.py generated/raw_dataset.json && \
python3 augment_dataset.py generated/raw_dataset.json generated/augmented_dataset.json && \
time python3 train.py generated/augmented_dataset.json generated/model distilgpt2 10 && \
zip -r generated.zip generated
```
and
```python
#@title Download dataset and trained model
from google.colab import files
files.download('sea-shanty-generator/generated.zip')
```
